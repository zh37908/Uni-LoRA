##  [NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight] Uni-LoRA: One Vector is All You Need

This repo contains the source code of [Uni-LoRA: One Vector is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00799).

Uni-LoRA is implemented following the standard interface of the 🤗 Hugging Face Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) library (see instruction_tuning/peft), making it easy to integrate into existing workflows. Our implementation is fully compatible with PEFT, and we plan to submit it for potential inclusion in the official PEFT library in the future.

## Abstract
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become the de facto parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method for large language models (LLMs) by constraining weight updates to low-rank matrices. Recent works such as Tied-LoRA, VeRA, and VB-LoRA push efficiency further by introducing additional constraints to reduce the trainable parameter space. In this paper, we show that the parameter space reduction strategies employed by these LoRA variants can be formulated within a unified framework, **Uni-LoRA**, where the LoRA parameter space, flattened as a high-dimensional vector space $\mathbb{R}^{D}$, can be reconstructed through a projection from a subspace $\mathbb{R}^{d}$, with $d\ll D$. We demonstrate that the fundamental difference among various LoRA methods lies in the choice of the projection matrix, $P \in \mathbb{R}^{D\times d}$. Most existing LoRA variants rely on layer-wise or structure-specific projections that limit cross-layer parameter sharing, thereby compromising parameter efficiency. In light of this, we introduce an efficient and theoretically grounded projection matrix that is isometric, enabling global parameter sharing and reducing computation overhead. Furthermore, under the unified view of Uni-LoRA, this design requires only a single trainable vector to reconstruct LoRA parameters for the entire LLM — making Uni-LoRA **both a unified framework and a "one-vector-only" solution**. Extensive experiments on GLUE, mathematical reasoning, and instruction tuning benchmarks demonstrate that Uni-LoRA achieves state-of-the-art parameter efficiency while outperforming or matching prior approaches in predictive performance.

<!---!**Uni-LoRA**  introduces a fixed, sparse, and isometric projection matrix $\mathbf{P}^{(D × d)}$, where $d<<D$ and each row contains exactly one nonzero entry. By multiplying $\mathbf{P}$ with a compact trainable vector $\theta_d$ (length $d$), Uni-LoRA reconstructs the full LoRA parameter $\theta_D$ (length $D$), enabling efficient fine-tuning with minimal trainable parameters and no architectural modifications.--->

Empirically, Uni-LoRA matches the performance of standard LoRA while updating only 0.52M parameters on GEMMA-7B — only 0.0061% of the base model size and 0.26% of the LoRA parameter count.
